👋 Hi, I'm Parth Singh Pal, a passionate front-end developer specializing in building dynamic and responsive web applications. With a strong foundation in web technologies and a keen interest in modern JavaScript frameworks, I love turning ideas into interactive digital experiences.

I graduated with a B.Tech in Information Technology in 2023 and am eager to apply my skills to real-world projects and collaborate with like-minded developers. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest in tech or contributing to open-source projects.

💻Previously worked at [Happiest Minds Technologies](https://www.happiestminds.com/)
<p>🍀I'm currently learning Next.js, and TypeScript</p>
<p>💡I'm looking forward to learning Angular.</p>
